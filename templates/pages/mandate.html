                      <p class="text-justify">The department is saddled with organizing radical enlightenment campaigns through the media by way of talk-show and jingles. this is to help create massive awareness on the activities of the monitoring and enforcement arm of the board in particular and RRBN in general. However, routine visit to centres for sensitization and monitoring can never be overlooked.
