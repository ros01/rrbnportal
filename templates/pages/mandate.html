                      <h6 class="font-weight-bold">SENSITIZATION VISITS TO HOSPITALS AND CENTERS</h6>
                      <p>Monitoring/sensitization visits are usually used to sensitize hospitals/diagnostic centers with a Radiography practice on the Radiography profession and the basic requirements for offering Radiography services in their hospital/center.
                      </p>
                      <h6 class="font-weight-bold">PUBLICITY</h6>
                      <p class="text-justify">The department is saddled with organizing radical enlightenment campaigns through the media by way of talk-shows and jingles. This is to help create massive awareness on the activities of the Inspection and Monitoring arm of the Board in particular and the RRBN in general. However, routine visits to centers for sensitization and monitoring can never be overlooked.
                      </p>
                      <h6 class="font-weight-bold">DATABASE</h6>
                      <p class="text-justify">The Inspection and Monitoring department on a continuous basis revalidates the database of hospitals and diagnostic centre that are fully accredited and registered by the board. Re-accreditation visits to some hospitals for internship and training of Radiography students is an on-going activity.
                      </p>
                      <h6 class="font-weight-bold">DISCIPLINARY FUNCTIONS</h6>
                      <p class="text-justify">RRBN also wishes to state that its disciplinary activities are on-going. The general public can report to the Board any act(s) of malpractice or negligence committed against them by registered Radiographers. Such reports can be made at headquarters in Abuja or our zonal offices in Lagos, Port Harcourt, Kano, Sokoto, Asaba, Calabar and Nnewi. Complaints can also be sent as email attachments to monitoring@rrbn.gov.ng. We solicit the co-operation and support of all stake holders in this effort to raise the standard of health care to optimum levels and also get rid of quacks in our society.
